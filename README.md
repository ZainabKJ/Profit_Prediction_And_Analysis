# Title: Analyzing Business Impact of Emerging Technologies Using Machine Learning

**Abstract** </br>
The important connection between financial performance, predictive modelling, and emerging technologies is covered in this dissertation. It aims to identify the profound effects of technology adoption on business profitability and the efficacy of various predictive models, with a specific focus on the automotive industry.
This research is important because it can help companies make evidence-based decisions. Using data collected regarding financial statements from three major companies and the integration of autonomous driving technology, this study uses linear regression, random forest, multiple linear regression, and long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) to predict business profitability. Additionally, these models are also used to examine the financial data that has been gathered through the comparison of the various outcomes presented. This strategy guarantees a comprehensive understanding of the financial dynamics and consequences of new technologies.
Through a close examination of the relationships that exist between the adoption of emerging technologies and changes in financial data, including revenue, gross profit, net income, and profitability, this research provides organisations with the indicators they need to adapt to the modern business environment. The impact of outside variables, such as changes in the economy, relating to the pandemic and inflationary pressures, and advances in technology, on financial results is also examined in this dissertation.
This study emphasises about how important machine algorithms are to linking business profitability and technological adoption in modern times relating to digitalization. Combining all the models utilised, it offers a comprehensive method for understanding and predicting the dynamics of business performance in modern times.
